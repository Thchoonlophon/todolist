<center><h1>TODO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal

## How&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;&nbsp;Run

First of all, open your terminal and `git clone https://github.com/Thchoonlophon/todolist.git`. After this, you need add the path of this project to the environment variable. And you also have to new environment variable, which named `MYSQL_HOST`,`MYSQL_PORT`,`MYSQL_DB`,`MYSQL_USER`,`MYSQL_PWD`. Of cause, I believe that you can know that you need have your own MySQL database, then you can use `todo -h` to get help info.

Enjoy!
